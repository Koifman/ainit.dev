# AI Behavior

Rules for how the AI assistant should operate.

- Read and understand existing code before suggesting modifications
- Preserve the existing code style and patterns in the project
- Make minimal, focused changes — do not refactor unrelated code
- Explain the reasoning behind non-obvious implementation choices
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Do not add features, libraries, or abstractions beyond what was requested
- Test changes locally before declaring them complete
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Do not remove or modify code that is outside the scope of the task
- Warn about potential breaking changes before making them
- Keep backward compatibility unless explicitly told to break it
- Never auto-commit or push without explicit permission
