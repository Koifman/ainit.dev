# Git Workflow

Rules for version control practices.

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages explaining the why
- Make small, focused commits — one logical change per commit
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or environment files
- Use feature branches for new work — do not commit directly to main
- Rebase or merge from main regularly to avoid large conflicts
- Review diff before committing to catch unintended changes
- Do not force-push to shared branches without team agreement
- Tag releases with semantic versioning
- Keep the git history clean and meaningful
- Include related test changes in the same commit as the code change
- Write PR descriptions that explain what changed and why
- Delete merged branches to keep the repository clean
