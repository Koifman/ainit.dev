# Code Style

Rules for consistent, readable code.

- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the codebase
- Use descriptive variable and function names that reveal intent
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Prefer early returns over deeply nested conditionals
- Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for JS/TS, snake_case for Python, etc.)
- Avoid magic numbers — use named constants with clear meaning
- Write self-documenting code; add comments only for non-obvious logic
- Keep line length reasonable (80-120 characters)
- Group related code together and separate concerns with blank lines
- Prefer explicit code over clever one-liners that sacrifice readability
- Use consistent import ordering (stdlib, external, internal)
- Avoid abbreviations in names unless they are universally understood
